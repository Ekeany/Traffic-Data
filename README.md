# Traffic-Data

## Introduction.

As everyone knows Galway has a serious transportation problem, due to its dependence on the private car. This dependency is heavily influenced by the weak public transport network, limited cycling facilities, large rural hinterland and it is position as the gateway to Connemara. Combining this with a road and street network that is desperately ill-suited to modern transportation. Has created crippling levels of traffic congestion that have directly affected the quality of life and functionality of this beautiful city. To counteract this problem, a fundamental shift is needed in the direction of sustainable travel and a reduction in the dependency on the private car; by creating a city that is more connected and accessible, thus enhancing the quality of life for all. The aim of this report was to not only analyse and visualise real traffic data from the N59 collected by Galway City Council, but to visualize the impact that public transport could have on daily traffic levels.

## Results.

The first plots describe the daily and weekly vehicle distributions of the eastbound and westbound traffic on the N59. To reduce the visual complexity of each graph a number of vehicle classes were merged together to create five classes, cars, vans, two wheeled, bus and heavy goods vehicle. The daily distributions were represented as a tilted bar chart whereas a pie chart was used for the weekly distributions. This dataset is slightly misleading as it suggests that there is a greater number of vans then cars on the road this is more than likely due to an error in data collection as some vans will have same axle with as a car, or a small HGV, so may be misclassified. Similarly the total number of cyclists may be under represented as some cyclists may not be detected if they cross the sensor at the same time as a vehicle or they simply are using the pavement. Despite this ratio of buses and less intrusive means of transport are significantly low.
